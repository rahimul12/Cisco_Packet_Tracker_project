# Cisco_Packet_Tracker_project

Project Brief:

You will have to design the network of a Hotel named Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. The hotel has 6 floors. First to Sixth floor houses the office of 6 departments- Reception, Store & Logistics, Food & Beverages, Human Resources, Management and IT accordingly. Design the network using the following instructions.

1.From the given Network ID, create 6 subnetworks; one for each floor. 

2.Each floor must have a separate router. All the routers should be directly connected to the router of  IT.

3.Routers of Reception, Store & Logistics and Management  should be connected with each other for better operations.

4.For connecting two routers you must use Serial Connection.

5.The networks between two routers can be anything you wish as long as its a valid IP address.

6.Each department must have at least 3 PCs. You can use Switch or Hub according to your preference.

7.You must use either OSPF or EIGRP as your routing protocol.

8.Reception, Management and IT must have web services available; meaning they should be able to do web browsing. You can implement it anyhow you wish.

9.At least  3 departments must have a DHCP server and the IP addresses of PCs in those networks should be provided using the DHCP server.

** *Bonus marks: Assign IP addresses for the users of all networks using a single DHCP server situated in the IT department. [If you can complete the bonus part, instruction no 9 is redundant for you you can ignore it.] ** *
